                                        For decades, the University has been involved in community outreach 
                                        and extension activities. When this was converted into Don Severino Agricultural 
                                        College (DSAC) in 1964, extension became one of the functions of this institution, 
                                        in addition to instruction and research. DSAC started with two major units, 
                                        the Secondary Department and the College Department. 
                                        The latter conducted extension services in the form of seminars on improved 
                                        farm practices and certified seeds and veterinary services to the 
                                        animals of the service area. In addition, the College maintained a one-and-a-half hectare 
                                        nursery for the propagation of and multiplication of important plants for 
                                        on-campus and for farmersâ€™ use. The Swine Project which was used for instruction 
                                        purposes also served as a source of foundation stock for farmers. Boar services 
                                        were made available to small hog raisers for the improvement of their stock 
                                        (DSAC Annual Report, SY 1968-69).

                                        Since then, the milestones of extension services were recorded in the Annual 
                                        Reports of this educational institution.
